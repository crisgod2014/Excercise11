Adrienne, The United Sates
What is my favorite food? I don't have a favorite food. I don't have a food that I would eat every day for the rest of my life if I could only choose one thing. That doesn't exist for me. I do like spicy food though, so anything spicy is good for me and the best foods are Mexican, Indian, Vietnamese, Thai. These are all some of my favorites because they are particularly spicy foods.
